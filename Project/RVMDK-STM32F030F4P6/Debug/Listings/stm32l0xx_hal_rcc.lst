N  * @brief   RCC HAL module driver.
N  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the Reset and Clock Control (RCC) peripheral:
N  *           + Initialization and de-initialization functions
N  *           + Peripheral Control functions
N  *       
N  @verbatim                
N  ==============================================================================
N                      ##### RCC specific features #####
N  ==============================================================================
N    [..]  
N      After reset the device is running from multispeed internal oscillator clock 
N      (MSI 2.097MHz) with Flash 0 wait state and Flash prefetch buffer is disabled, 
N      and all peripherals are off except internal SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
N      (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) buses;
N          all peripherals mapped on these buses are running at MSI speed.
N      (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
N      (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
N          are assigned to be used for debug purpose.
N    [..] Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
N      (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
N          (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
N      (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings  
N      (+) Configure the AHB and APB buses prescalers
N      (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
N      (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals whose clocks are not
N          derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG) 
N          (*) SDIO only for STM32L0xxxD devices
N
N                      ##### RCC Limitations #####
N  ==============================================================================
N    [..]  
N      A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral 
N      enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write 
N      from/to registers.
N      (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
N        (++) AHB & APB peripherals, 1 dummy read is necessary
N
N    [..]  
N      Workarounds:
N      (#) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
N          inserted in each __HAL_RCC_PPP_CLK_ENABLE() macro.
