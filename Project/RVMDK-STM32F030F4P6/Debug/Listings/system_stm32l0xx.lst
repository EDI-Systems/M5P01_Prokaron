N  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M0+ Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
N  *
N  *   This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
N  *   user application:
N  *      - SystemInit(): This function is called at startup just after reset and 
N  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
N  *                      the "startup_stm32l0xx.s" file.
N  *
N  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
N  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
N  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
N  *                                     
N  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
N  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
N  *                                 during program execution.
