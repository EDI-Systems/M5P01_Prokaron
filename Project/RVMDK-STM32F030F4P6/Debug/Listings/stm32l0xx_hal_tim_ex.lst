N  * @brief   TIM HAL module driver.
N  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the Timer (TIM) peripheral:
N  *           + Time Hall Sensor Interface Initialization
N  *           + Time Hall Sensor Interface Start
N  *           + Time Master and Slave synchronization configuration

N================================================================================
N          ##### TIM specific features integration #####
N================================================================================
N           
N    [..] The Timer features include: 
N         (#) 16-bit up, down, up/down auto-reload counter.
N         (#) 16-bit programmable prescaler allowing dividing (also on the fly) the counter clock
N             frequency either by any factor between 1 and 65536.
N         (#) Up to 4 independent channels for:
N           Input Capture
N           Output Compare
N           PWM generation (Edge and Center-aligned Mode)
N           One-pulse mode output
N         (#) Synchronization circuit to control the timer with external signals and to interconnect
N            several timers together.
N         (#) Supports incremental (quadrature) encoder and hall-sensor circuitry for positioning
N           purposes               
N   
N            ##### How to use this driver #####
N================================================================================
N    [..]
N     (#) Enable the TIM interface clock using 
N         __HAL_RCC_TIMx_CLK_ENABLE(); 
N       
N     (#) TIM pins configuration
N          (++) Enable the clock for the TIM GPIOs using the following function:
N              __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();   
N          (++) Configure these TIM pins in Alternate function mode using HAL_GPIO_Init();  
N
N     (#) The external Clock can be configured, if needed (the default clock is the internal clock from the APBx), 
N         using the following function:
N         HAL_TIM_ConfigClockSource, the clock configuration should be done before any start function.
N  
N     (#) Configure the TIM in the desired operating mode using one of the 
N         configuration function of this driver:
N          (++) HAL_TIMEx_MasterConfigSynchronization() to configure the peripheral in master mode.
N
N     (#) Remap the Timer I/O using HAL_TIMEx_RemapConfig() API.
