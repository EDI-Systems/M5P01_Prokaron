N  * @brief   DMA HAL module driver.
N  *    
N  *         This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *         functionalities of the Direct Memory Access (DMA) peripheral:
N  *           + Initialization/de-initialization functions
N  *           + I/O operation functions
N  *           + Peripheral State functions
N  *

N  ==============================================================================      
N                        ##### How to use this driver #####
N  ============================================================================== 
N  [..]
N   (#) Enable and configure the peripheral to be connected to the DMA Channel
N       (except for internal SRAM / FLASH memories: no initialization is 
N       necessary). 
N          
N   (#) For a given Channel, program the required configuration through the following parameters:   
N       Channel request, Transfer Direction, Source and Destination data formats, 
N       Circular, Normal or peripheral flow control mode, Channel Priority level, 
N       Source and Destination Increment mode using HAL_DMA_Init() function.
N   
N     *** Polling mode IO operation ***
N     =================================   
N    [..] 
N          (+) Use HAL_DMA_Start() to start DMA transfer after the configuration of Source 
N              address and destination address and the Length of data to be transferred
N          (+) Use HAL_DMA_PollForTransfer() to poll for the end of current transfer, in this  
N              case a fixed Timeout can be configured by User depending from his application.
N               
N     *** Interrupt mode IO operation ***    
N     =================================== 
N    [..]     
N          (+) Configure the DMA interrupt priority using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
N          (+) Enable the DMA IRQ handler using HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ() 
N          (+) Use HAL_DMA_Start_IT() to start DMA transfer after the configuration of  
N              Source address and destination address and the Length of data to be transferred. In this 
N              case the DMA interrupt is configured 
N          (+) Use HAL_DMA_IRQHandler() called under DMA_IRQHandler() Interrupt subroutine
N          (+) At the end of data transfer HAL_DMA_IRQHandler() function is executed and user can 
N              add his own function by customization of function pointer XferCpltCallback and 
N              XferErrorCallback (i.e a member of DMA handle structure). 
N                
N   (#) Use HAL_DMA_GetState() function to return the DMA state and HAL_DMA_GetError() in case of error 
N       detection.
N         
N   (#) Use HAL_DMA_Abort() function to abort the current transfer              
N                   
N   -@-   In Memory-to-Memory transfer mode, Circular mode is not allowed.
