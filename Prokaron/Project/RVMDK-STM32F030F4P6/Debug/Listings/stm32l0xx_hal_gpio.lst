N  * @brief   GPIO HAL module driver.  
N  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) peripheral:
N  *           + Initialization and de-initialization functions
N  *           + IO operation functions
N  *

N  ==============================================================================
N                    ##### GPIO Peripheral features #####
N  ==============================================================================
N  [..] 
N    (+) Each port bit of the general-purpose I/O (GPIO) ports can be individually 
N  configured by software in several modes:
N        (++) Input mode 
N        (++) Analog mode
N        (++) Output mode
N        (++) Alternate function mode
N        (++) External interrupt/event lines
N 
N    (+) During and just after reset, the alternate functions and external interrupt  
N  lines are not active and the I/O ports are configured in input floating mode.
N  
N    (+) All GPIO pins have weak internal pull-up and pull-down resistors, which can be 
N  activated or not.
N
N    (+) In Output or Alternate mode, each IO can be configured on open-drain or push-pull
N  type and the IO speed can be selected depending on the VDD value.
N  
N    (+) The microcontroller IO pins are connected to onboard peripherals/modules through a 
N        multiplexer that allows only one peripheral alternate function (AF) connected 
N  to an IO pin at a time. In this way, there can be no conflict between peripherals 
N  sharing the same IO pin. 
N
N    (+) All ports have external interrupt/event capability. To use external interrupt 
N  lines, the port must be configured in input mode. All available GPIO pins are 
N  connected to the 16 external interrupt/event lines from EXTI0 to EXTI15.
N  
N    (+) The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 28 edge detectors
N  (16 lines are connected to GPIO) for generating event/interrupt requests (each 
N  input line can be independently configured to select the type (interrupt or event) 
N  and the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both). Each line can 
N  also be masked independently. 
N  
N                     ##### How to use this driver #####
N  ==============================================================================  
N  [..]             
N    (#) Enable the GPIO IOPORT clock using the following function: __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE(). 
N
N    (#) Configure the GPIO pin(s) using HAL_GPIO_Init().
N        (++) Configure the IO mode using "Mode" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure
N        (++) Activate Pull-up, Pull-down resistor using "Pull" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef 
N             structure.
N        (++) In case of Output or alternate function mode selection: the speed is 
N             configured through "Speed" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure.
N        (++) In alternate mode is selection, the alternate function connected to the IO
N             is configured through "Alternate" member from GPIO_InitTypeDef structure.
N        (++) Analog mode is required when a pin is to be used as ADC channel 
N             or DAC output.
N        (++) In case of external interrupt/event selection the "Mode" member from 
N             GPIO_InitTypeDef structure select the type (interrupt or event) and 
N             the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both).
N   
N    (#) In case of external interrupt/event mode selection, configure NVIC IRQ priority 
N        mapped to the EXTI line using HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() and enable it using
N        HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ().
N         
N   (#) HAL_GPIO_DeInit allows to set register values to their reset value. This function
N       is also to be used when unconfiguring pin which was used as an external interrupt
N       or in event mode. That is the only way to reset the corresponding bit in
N       EXTI & SYSCFG registers.
N
N    (#) To get the level of a pin configured in input mode use HAL_GPIO_ReadPin().
N            
N    (#) To set/reset the level of a pin configured in output mode use 
N        HAL_GPIO_WritePin()/HAL_GPIO_TogglePin().
N
N    (#) To lock pin configuration until next reset use HAL_GPIO_LockPin().
N
N    (#) During and just after reset, the alternate functions are not 
N        active and the GPIO pins are configured in input floating mode (except JTAG
N        pins).
N  
N    (#) The LSE oscillator pins OSC32_IN and OSC32_OUT can be used as general purpose 
N        (PC14 and PC15, respectively) when the LSE oscillator is off. The LSE has 
N        priority over the GPIO function.
N  
N    (#) The HSE oscillator pins OSC_IN/OSC_OUT can be used as 
N        general purpose PH0 and PH1, respectively, when the HSE oscillator is off. 
N        The HSE has priority over the GPIO function.
